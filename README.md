# üß† NLP Basics for RAG

This repository contains the code and resources for **Series 1: NLP Basics for RAG** from the LinkedIn article *"Mastering Chatbots with RAG: From Theory to Production"* by **PhD. Abdelouaheb Hocine**.

## üìñ Overview
Before diving into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it‚Äôs important to understand the fundamentals of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
This project introduces:
- **Tokenization** (splitting text into smaller units)
- **Stopwords removal**
- **Vectorization (Bag of Words)**
- **Document similarity with cosine similarity**

These are the first building blocks toward embeddings and vector databases, which are essential for RAG.
